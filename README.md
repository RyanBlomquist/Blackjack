# Blackjack
Author: Ryan Blomquist

 A Blackjack card game for Praeses's job interview.

 To run this game, download all the project contents, including img and svg directories,  and open the index.html file with a web browser.  Development was done on Firefox, and it works on Google Chrome too.  This project depends on jQuery, which is included in the repository.
 
 This project uses card.js, a library written by Einar Egilsson, to handle generic card operations, visuals, and animations.
